# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## gstack

This project uses [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) for AI-assisted
workflows. In Claude Code on the web it is installed automatically by the
SessionStart hook (`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`); on a local machine,
install it with:

```bash
git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git ~/.claude/skills/gstack
cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && ./setup
```

Use the /browse skill from gstack for all web browsing; never use
mcp__claude-in-chrome__* tools. Available skills: /office-hours,
/plan-ceo-review, /plan-eng-review, /plan-design-review, /design-consultation,
/design-shotgun, /design-html, /review, /ship, /land-and-deploy, /canary,
/benchmark, /browse, /connect-chrome, /qa, /qa-only, /design-review,
/setup-browser-cookies, /setup-deploy, /setup-gbrain, /retro, /investigate,
/document-release, /document-generate, /codex, /cso, /autoplan,
/plan-devex-review, /devex-review, /careful, /freeze, /guard, /unfreeze,
/gstack-upgrade, /learn.

Use ~/.claude/skills/gstack/... for gstack file paths.
